# Crack-Detection

- Developed, tested, and integrated machine learning models for detecting cracks in WRB and Seam Taping using PyTorch, improving defect detection capabilities.
- Designed and implemented data preprocessing pipelines, and created scalable backend services using FastAPI, Docker, and microservice architecture to support the automated detection system.
